  </div>
</div-->

The VOT challenges provide the visual tracking community with a precisely defined and repeatable way of comparing short-term trackers as well as a common platform for discussing the evaluation and advancements made in the field of visual tracking.

The goal of the challenges is to build up a repository of considerable benchmarks and to organize workshops or similar events in order to push forward research in visual tracking.

    The dataset has been updated, we have also introduced a real-time experiment. Because of this we will no longer support the legacy VOT2013 integration. All trackers must be integrated with the TraX protocol. Challenge winner will be determined on a sequestered dataset.
