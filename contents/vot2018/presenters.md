## Guidelines for the Poster

Prepare a poster to present your paper at the workshop venue. Posters need to be in portrait mode. The poster boards are 1.20x1.00 meters and cannot hold landscape posters. Poster will be presented in a common area between 10am - 11am (please, see the final workshop programme on the VOT webpage). The exact venue is currently not decided, information will follow on the webpage. Poster presenters are asked to install their posters before workshop start (8:30am), latest before the poster session. Posters are to be removed from the poster boards by the presenters at the end of the session. If not removed, volunteers will collect the remaining ones.


## Guidelines for Spotlight Presentation

We ask you to submit a spotlight video of your poster until 6 September 2018 within CMT. File size must not exceed 100MB.

Spotlight slides need to be converted to video. If you prepare your presentation using PowerPoint you can time your slides and save the presentation as a WMV video directly from PowerPoint. Some instructions on how to do this can be found [here](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Turn-your-presentation-into-a-video-c140551f-cb37-4818-b5d4-3e30815c3e83). You will then need to convert the WMV video into MP4 (e.g. via Youtube or FFMPEG).

For your spotlight presentation there is only one format: MP4 video of the slides with resolution of 1280x720 HP with H264 encoding (This is the default codec for almost all MP4 encoders). It should NOT be an AVI file or a MOV but a proper MP4 (and don't just rename it). You might use Youtube or FFMPEG to convert formats. This will enable us to load all talks onto the same laptop without any configuration/format issues while allowing presenters to use whatever graphics/video tools they choose to generate the presentation. Presentations should be limited to 4 minutes and 55 seconds with the next speaker's video starting automatically at the 5-minute mark. The videos will be combined into one large video that will play each in turn; there will be no presenter control and the next presentation will just start. If your video is longer than 4:55 it will be truncated. If your video is not in the proper format, it will be converted as best as our automated tool will do and probably of lower quality and could even be solid black.

The session chair will not be introducing each spotlight, therefore, please ensure your video starts with a title slide. When presenting introduce yourself. You will talk during the video just as you would with the slides. The difference is that the timing will be automatic and consistent. This should be used as a visual aid to your live presentation, i.e., you will be talking in front of this video as it plays projected on the main screen. Note that the audio channel from your submitted video will NOT be used. You will be allowed to bring up notes for the talk, e.g., a tablet/laptop with your presentation notes for local viewing. This format of presentation will allow you to practice your talk with the exact timing needed for the rapid short oral session. There will be no time allotted for "questions" after each spotlight.


## Guidelines for Publication

Workshop participants have the opportunity to update their paper after the workshop in case comments arise during the event.

The ECCV Workshop paper submission guidelines are the same with the [camera ready guidelines of the ECCV](https://eccv2018.org/papersubmission/camera-ready-paper-guidelines/), please follow these carefully.

Please submit the following material via CMT: A ZIP file called W03PXX.zip, where XX is the submission ID of your paper. Please use zero-padding for the paper number. For instance if your paper ID is 4, the paper should be represented with 'WYYP04.zip'

This zip file should contain, just like main ECCV submissions, the following items:

a: A single pdf for the camera-ready version of the paper, entitled W03PXX.pdf
b: A single pdf or zip for supplementary files, entitled W03PXX-supp.pdf or W03PXX-supp.zip (up to 100Mb in size)
c: A single zip file containing a folder called \source\, containing all source files (tex, bbl, figures…) of the paper. There should not be a compiled pdf of the paper in this folder. Please do not send source files for supplementary material.
d: A single pdf, manually signed and scanned, 3-page copyright named W03PXX-copyright.pdf. The copyright for workshop papers is different from the main conference, please use [this document](https://eccv2018.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ECCV-Workshop-2018-Copyright-Form.pdf).

Please use the updated [camera-ready paper kit](https://eccv2018.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/eccv2018camerareadykit.zip) in preparing your paper.

Your camera-ready submission should have no ruler (as in initial submissions), Acknowledgements should not be in a footnote on the first page (but in an unnumbered subsection at the end), the figures should look legible, and the author running and title running should be properly set. Unlike the main ECCV papers, contributions can be longer than 14 pages.

We need all source files (LaTeX files with all the associated style files, special fonts and eps files, or Word or rtf files) and the final pdf of the paper. References are to be supplied as Bbl files to avoid omission of data while conversion from Bib to Bbl. Please do not send any older versions of papers. There should be one set of source files and one pdf file per paper. Springer typesetters require the author-created pdfs in order to check the proper representation of symbols, figures, etc. Please note that CVF will publish a version of the paper (submitted pdf's before Springer's editing) on its website. These versions will be openly accessible.

The ECCV policy on author changes is very strict this year. If the camera-ready submission has a different author list from the submitted paper, please ask immediately.
