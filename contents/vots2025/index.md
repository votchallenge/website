# VOTS2025 Challenge

Visual Object Tracking and Segmentation challenge VOTS2025 is a continuation of the VOTS2023 and VOTS2024 challenges, which no longer distinct between single- and multi-target tracking nor between short- and long-term tracking. It requires tracking one or more targets simultaneously by segmentation over long or short sequences, while the targets may disappear during tracking and reappear later in the video.

Three challenges are organized:

 * VOTS2025 challenge - Continuation of the VOTS2023 and VOTS2024 challenges. The task is to track one or more general targets over short-term or long-term sequences by segmentation. 
 * VOTS2025-RT challenge - The real-time version of the main VOTS2025 challenge. The task is to track one or more general targets over short-term or long-term sequences by segmentation in a real-time setup, i.e. frames are given to the tracker in a constant frame-rate, regardless of the tracker latency.
 * VOTSt2025 challenge - Continuation of the VOTSt2024 challenge considers general objects undergoing a topological transformation, such as vegetables cut into pieces, machines disassembled, etc.
